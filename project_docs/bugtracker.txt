4 bugs (Scary) (Normal Confidence) in RegistrationManager
1) Read of unwritten field courseCatalog in edu.ncsu.csc216.pack_scheduler.manager.RegistrationManager.clearData()
2) Read of unwritten field registrar in edu.ncsu.csc216.pack_scheduler.manager.RegistrationManager.login(String, String)
3) Read of unwritten field studentDirectory in edu.ncsu.csc216.pack_scheduler.manager.RegistrationManager.clearData()
4) Read of unwritten field studentDirectory in edu.ncsu.csc216.pack_scheduler.manager.RegistrationManager.login(String, String)

Bugs above corrected by initializing in constructor.

Reordered login() to check for Registrar login before Student login to avoid incorrect throw of IllegalArgumentException based on ID not in StudentDirectory

line 145 in RegistrationManager had currentUser resetting to Registrar instead of null

Added line to check if currentUser == null, to avoid new login while another User is currently logged into system.

Missing error messages to alert User to issues with incorrect password or User id.  New IllegalArgumentException added to login() to fix.
