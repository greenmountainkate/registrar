# PackScheduler

This program is a model of a registration scheduling system that would have basic functionality for a university system.  

Thorough documentation can be found in the javadoc, found in the PackScheduler/doc file.  

The main flow of control is through the UI, which allows users to log in as one of three potential user classes:
  - Registrar
  - Faculty
  - Student
  
  Depending on the user class, there are various options available, which include:
  
    - adding/modifying/removing/saving a student directory
    - adding/modifying/removing/saving a faculty directory
    - adding/modifying/removing/saving a course catalog
    - assigning faculty to teach a course
    - enrolling/dropping a student into/from a course
    
  The program is tested with JUnit tests and documented with Javadoc.
